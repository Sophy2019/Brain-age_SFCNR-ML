# Deep Learning-based Brain Age Prediction in Patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders
This repository provides the R implementation and results of brain age prediction using three machine learning models and some statistical analysis.
## Mechine Learning Models
Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Relevance Vector Regressor.
## Datasets
The datasets utilized for the training and validating models were procured from multiple sources: Jeonbuk National University Hospital (JBUH), Korea University Anam Hospital (KUAH), and the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR). The latter's dataset is accessible at http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/index.html.
From the CoRR database, the participants' demographic for the study was specifically selected from the Asian population, with an age range between 18 and 75 years. The detailed dataset composition from the CoRR database is 56 subjects from Beijing Normal University, 98 subjects from the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 29 subjects from Jinling Hospital at Nanjing University, 70 subjects from Southwest University, and 21 subjects from Xuanwu Hospital, affiliated with Capital University of Medical Sciences.
